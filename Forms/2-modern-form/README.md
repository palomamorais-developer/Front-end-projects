First layout trying to implement BEM with SCSS, but it was a little hard to understand all the rules, so my code was messy and unnecessary robust.

Final layout i did some improvements in the code, now is more clean to understand. Also while studying BEM, I did some changes in the interface.At First layout, The icon was positioned inside the input through `position:relative>position:absolute`, now the icon is inside of a placeholder. (First way is better, i guess, seems more elegant). The layout is responsive using desktop first.
